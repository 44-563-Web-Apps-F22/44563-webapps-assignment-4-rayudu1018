        <h5>SCENE-the same scene as in Act I with the exception that in place
            of the ruins that filled the foreground of the stage, the
            interior of a magnificent temple is seen showing the background
            of the scene of Act I, through the columns of the portico at the
            back. High throne. L.U.E. Low seats below it.  All the substitute
            gods and goddesses [that is to say, Thespians] are discovered
            grouped in picturesque attitudes about the stage, eating and
            drinking, and smoking and singing the following verses.</h5>

            the Olympian stage-manager I ought to be strict with them and
            make them do their duty, but i can't.  Bless their little hearts,
            when I see the pretty little craft come sailing up to me with a
            wheedling smile on their pretty little figure-heads, I can't turn
            my back on 'em.  I'm all bow, though I'm sure I try to be stern.</p>
